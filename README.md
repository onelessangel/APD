# APD - Parallel and Distributed Algorithms

## Pthreads

Parallel processing using the Map-Reduce paradigm.

Implementation of a parallel program in Pthreads for finding numbers that are perfect powers
from a set of files and counting unique values for each exponent.

## Java Multithreading

A Java program for a Black Friday order manager, using parallelization mechanisms.

The program uses multiple entities to handle 2 level threads for processing in parallel the orders
and the products.

## MPI

An implementation for collaborative calculations in distributed systems.

Given 4 clusters and an arbitrary number of workers, the program uses the MPI standard for:
- establishing the topology;
- computing a given vector;
- bypassing possible communication channel errors.
